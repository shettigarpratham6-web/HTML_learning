    <h1><u>Spider-man</u></h1>
    <p><b>Spider-Man</b> is one of the most popular superheroes in the world, created by writer Stan Lee and artist
        Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics in 1962. His real identity is Peter Parker, a young boy from New York who gains
        superpowers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. With his new abilities such as wall-crawling, super
        strength, agility, and a special “spider-sense” that warns him of danger, Peter creates his own web-shooters to
        swing through the city and fight criminals. Unlike many other heroes, Spider-Man’s story is relatable because he
        faces real-life struggles like school, relationships, and financial problems, while also living with the burden
        of protecting others. His life is shaped by the tragic death of his Uncle Ben, which teaches him the famous
        lesson: “With great power comes great responsibility.”</p>
    <p>Over the years, Spider-Man has battled some of the most famous villains in comic history, including the Green
        Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom, Lizard, Sandman, and the Vulture. He is often portrayed as a symbol of hope for
        ordinary people, showing that even a regular teenager can be a hero. Beyond Peter Parker, the Spider-Man legacy
        has expanded to other characters like Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy (Spider-Gwen), and Spider-Man 2099, especially
        in the multiverse stories. Spider-Man has also been adapted into television shows, animated series, blockbuster
        films, and video games, making him a cultural icon across generations. His enduring popularity lies in the fact
        that he is not just a superhero but also a character who reflects the challenges, responsibilities, and
        resilience of everyday life.</p>
